            Muhammad Ali Jinnah (Urdu: محمد علی جناح [mʊɦəmːəd̪ əli d͡ʒɪnɑː(ɦ)];
            born Mahomedali Jinnahbhai; 25 December 1876 – 11 September 1948)
            was a barrister, politician and the founder of Pakistan. Jinnah
            served as the leader of the All-India Muslim League from 1913 until
            the inception of Pakistan on 14 August 1947, and then as the
            Dominion of Pakistan's first governor-general until his death.

            Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a barrister
            at Lincoln's Inn in London, England. Upon his return to India, he
            enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in national
            politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose
            to prominence in the Indian National Congress in the first two
            decades of the 20th century.

            By 1940, Jinnah had come to believe that the Muslims of the
            subcontinent should have their own state to avoid the possible
            marginalised status they may gain in an independent Hindu–Muslim
            state. In that year, the Muslim League, led by Jinnah, passed the
            Lahore Resolution, demanding a separate nation for Indian Muslims.

            As the first governor-general of Pakistan, Jinnah worked to
            establish the new nation's government and policies, and to aid the
            millions of Muslim migrants who had emigrated from neighbouring
            India to Pakistan after the two states' independence, personally
            supervising the establishment of refugee camps. Jinnah died at age
            71 in September 1948, just over a year after Pakistan gained
            independence from the United Kingdom.
